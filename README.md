# Titanic

## Information
The [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) dataset contains information on different passengers on the Titanic. I aim to use machine learning models
and data modeling to determine factors that affect whether the person survived based on age, class, sex, etc. We want to separate the data for ones for training and testing and 
I used the training dataset to make predictions on the testing dataset to verify if my model was accurate.
